Determining the Relationship Between Opening Weekend Results, Critical Reviews, and Box Office Success
-

Objectives
-
- Our goal was to find some way to predict box office success using box office revenue.

- More specifically we wanted to explore the relationship between critic + viewer ratings and box office revenue. Do critically-acclaimed films achieve box office success? Or, do films rated highly by audiences perform better?

- We also looked at domestic opening weekend revenue from 2013-2018 as an indicator of what audiences are excited to see, and if high opening weekend revenue indicated that a film would perform well overall. 

- Overall, we found that reviews are not correlated to gross revenue, but opening weekend revenue is strongly correlated to the total gross revenue. We can even use this relationship to predict the total gross revenue based on opening weekend revenue


Process
-

- We joined data from Box Office Mojo and Metacritic to compare the criticâ€™s score to gross revenue from the year 2018.
